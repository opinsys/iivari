Iivari client
=============
Provides a custom WebKit browser for stand-alone kiosk display.

This is a replacement for the [stand-alone Chromium script](https://github.com/opinsys/iivari/wiki/Client-installation-instructions)

Software requirements

*   Python >= 2.6
*   PySide >= 1.0.0 (>= 1.0.7 preferred)
*   Qt >= 4.6

To install PySide on Ubuntu, enable the community repository and install the `python-pyside` meta-package. This will also pull all required Qt packages.

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pyside
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install python-pyside

Setup
-----

Insert the server url into `iivari/settings.py`.

Run the tests with nose (contains integration tests so ensure the iivari server is running):

      sudo apt-get install python-pip
      sudo pip install nose
      nosetests

Test the display hardware in offline mode:

      bin/iivari-display_test_pattern

Start the kiosk slideshow:

      bin/iivari-kiosk

You may optionally specify kiosk hostname and screen resolution as input parameters. An interactive JavaScript console is also available in the REPL mode. See "`iivari-kiosk --help`" for usage.

For example:

      bin/iivari-kiosk -n kiosk1

Starts with the hostname "kiosk1".

* * *
**NOTE**: some built-in features will intentionally kill the client process.
This is for the OS to prevent possible memory leaks from happening if QWebView would be restarted programmatically inside the process.

**This leaves a requirement for a watchdog process restarting the client when it exits.**

Such as

      while (true); do bin/iivari-kiosk; done
